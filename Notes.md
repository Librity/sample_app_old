Lo list all processes:
```
$ ps aux
```
To search a text file for matching input/pattern:
```
$ grep *whatever*
```
To filter running processes by type, run the output of ps through a pipe (|) into grep  
(In this case we're looking for spring processes generated by rails server)
```
$ ps aux | grep spring

```
$ ps aux | grep server

```
To kill a process by ID
```
$ kill -15 9289
$ kill 11890
```
It's recomended to try and *Stop* a process before killing it
```
$ spring stop
```
To kill a process by name
```
$ kill -15 -f spring
```
To run Guard once Guardfile is configured
```
$ bundle exec guard
```
*Guard Files are really sensitive to comments/embeded files*  
To run all tests, hit return at the guard> console prompt  
To exit, hit ctrl+d (just like the rails console)
